Alright here's a steam of consciousness for tips on modding dicks into BG3 because it's late and I'm over it

I won't be providing links, I trust you to be capable with google

HOW TO LEARN HOW TO DO THIS STUFF ON YOUR OWN
Follow youtube tutorials for the 3D modelling stuff. In particular, Padme4000's videos are a great starting point.

You can also use the Modder's Multitool to unpacked .pak files of other mods to reverse engineer them.

Don't bother asking the Larian Discord they're all awful.

PROGRAMS YOU NEED
Blender (For editing models), including DOS2/BG3 Collada Exporter extension
BG3 Modder's Multitool, along with LSLib
BG3 Mod Manager
Notepad++ to edit .lsx files

RANDOM BLENDER TIPS
An easy way to take an existing dick and merge it onto the base of another race is to delete the outmost vertices of the dick you want, select the same vertices on the base,
invert selection, then delete faces, merge the two objects (make sure to rename the vertex color and UV map attributes to what's on the base mesh if you want it to merge properly),
select the edge loops you want to merge, and Bridge Edge Loops (check the Merge option). Smooth vertices as needed.

Genitals will only disappear when clothed if correctly painted with the green vertex color.

The dicks are actually mirrored ingame, so the left side in Blender will be on the right ingame.

If you need more help you can try commenting on my mod page and I'll try to answer but you have to understand I cannot possibly teach a stranger all the things
you need to know to use Blender effectively, I've been modelling in Blender for a long time now.
